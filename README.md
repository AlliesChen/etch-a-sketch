This is a practice in the odin project:
[the requirement for this function](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

You can color the grids plate when having your mouse over a grid. The color gets darken by each step you made, and will be full black in 10 steps after.

The initial plate has 16*16 grids. Using the reset button on the left top corner, you can clear the color and make a new x\*x grids plate. The range for the 'x' is 1 to 100 without digits after decimal.
